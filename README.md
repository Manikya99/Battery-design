# Thermal Modeling of the Battery Pack

## Overview
This project involves the thermal modeling of a 10-cell series lithium-ion battery pack. The objective is to simulate the thermal effects and compare life cycle performance at various temperatures and charge/discharge rates using MATLAB.

## Features
- **Simulation of thermal behavior:** Analyze the temperature impact on the State of Charge (SoC) and overall battery performance.
- **Temperature variation:** Test the battery at different operating temperatures ranging from 300K to 390K.
- **MATLAB Implementation:** Utilize MATLAB Simscape for thermal modeling and simulation.



## Requirements
- MATLAB with Simscape and Simulink
- Basic understanding of battery management systems

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the `simulink_model` folder.
3. Open the Simulink model and run the simulation.
4. Observe the results in the `results` folder.

## Results
The results indicate that the State of Charge (SoC) decreases as the temperature increases, leading to faster discharge and reduced battery life. Detailed graphs and data can be found in the `results` folder.
